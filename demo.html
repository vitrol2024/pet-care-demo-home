          COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR DOG AND DEVELOP A RELATIONSHIP.
          Dogs are social creatures and they need to interact with their owner.
          Quality time will help you get to know your dog and understand  particular needs that it might have,
          as well enhance your ability to recognize early signs of an illness that could be developing.
          In addition, time spent in developing a relationship will help prevent many undesirable behavioral patterns.

               Environment is an important part of the health and wellbeing of your cat.
               A favourable environment is one in which the cat can become safely socialised without too many problems,
                and that helps them get used to the people and the things around them.
                When you first bring your cat home, you will need the basics.
                These include:
                <ol>
                 <li>
                  Baskets

               <li>

               One of the most important aspects of caring for a fish is ensuring it has sufficient space.
               According to the experts at Fishkeeping World, bigger is better when it comes to fish tanks.
               A large aquarium not only ensures your fish has ample room to swim, explore and grow, but it is also easier for you to maintain.
               Keeping the temperature and pH balanced is easier with a large tank than with a small one.
